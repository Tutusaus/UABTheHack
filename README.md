# Hackathon Project: Mobile Banking Service Optimization

In May 18-19 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in a hackathon at Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona. This event allowed me to collaborate with a talented team to tackle real-world challenges and innovate in meaningful ways.

## üöö Project Overview

Our team took on a unique challenge presented by **Grupo Caja de Ingenieros**: to design an innovative solution for their upcoming **mobile banking service truck**. This mobile service is set to travel to various towns without local bank branches, providing essential banking services to underserved communities.

Our mission was to build a **smart app and system** to guide the mobile banking truck to its next destination while accounting for real-world conditions. This would ensure the truck could efficiently serve as many people as possible across various locations.

## üìç Our Mission

The app needed to fulfill several critical goals:

1. **Optimize the Truck's Route**: Ensure efficient travel between towns.
2. **Provide Flexibility for Customization**: Allow staff to adjust parameters to optimize routes in real-time.

### Key Routing Parameters:
- **Starting Point** of the truck
- **Distances** between towns
- **Traffic Conditions** and estimated travel time
- **Working Hours** for truck staff
- **Population Size** of each town to manage waiting times and ensure everyone has access to the service

## üìã Solution Outline

The challenge involved a custom version of the well-known **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, adapted to consider weighted parameters such as population size, traffic conditions, and staff schedules. **Caixa d'Enginyers** provided a list of towns with relevant data, which our team used as the foundation for route optimization.

Through strategic problem-solving and algorithm design, we developed an efficient routing system that dynamically adapted to changing conditions.

## üîß Technical Approach

Our development approach was as follows:

- **Programming Language**: We used **Python** for its versatility and rich library support.
- **Data Management**: The **pandas** library was crucial for managing and processing data files.
- **Algorithm Design**: We crafted algorithms that prioritized and adjusted routing based on real-time inputs for effective and reliable solutions.

The completed system allowed truck staff to focus on serving community members while the app managed logistical complexities.
